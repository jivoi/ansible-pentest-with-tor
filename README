Use Tor for anonymous scanning with nmap 
We will setup tor, tortunnel and use the most quick tor exit node.

$ torify nmap -P0 -sT -p 80 97.74.144.148 (-P0 is to avoid ICMP leak)
$ proxychains nmap -P0 -sT -p 80,443,21,23 [targetIPAddress]
$ tor-resolve google.com (lookup host by IP address)

Run and relax
